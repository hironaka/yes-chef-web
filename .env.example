# For Heroku Deployment (or similar environments where placing a key file is difficult):
# Store the *entire content* of your downloaded GCP service account JSON key here.
# The Procfile will write this to /tmp/gcp-key.json at runtime.

# The GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS variable will be set automatically by the Procfile
# to point to /tmp/gcp-key.json when deploying to Heroku.
# For local development, you can either:
# 1. Set GCP_SA_KEY_JSON and run with the Heroku Procfile command (e.g., using `heroku local`).
# 2. Download the key file, save it securely (e.g., outside the repo), and set:
#    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/secure/keyfile.json"
# 3. Run `gcloud auth application-default login` in your local terminal.
