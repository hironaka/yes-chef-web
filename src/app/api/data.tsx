Per others' suggestions, I made the following changes: 1) used brown suger instead of white 2) used fresh basil instead of dried 3) used red wine instead of water 4)didn't boil the noodles...just soaked them in hot water while the sauce was cooking. 5) added a couple dashes of nutmeg to the ricotta cheese mixture 6) used shredded mozarella instead of slices.\n\nThis recipe makes A LOT of sauce. I had about 2 cups left over even after I was generous with it in my layering.\n\nMy boyfriend LOVED it and said it's the best he's ever had. I didn't find it all that 'labor intensive' to make considering it is lasagna! Thanks for this recipe!",

Despite that, this one is so good that I am sure my mother and grandmother are smiling down from heaven in approval! I saw this same recipe on another site and it only called for 1 teaspoon of salt, not 1 tablespoon. It came out perfect with the lower amount of salt. It also did not call for any salt in the ricotta. I have some recommendations, below: Cut down the water to 1/4 cup. It makes a slightly thicker sauce and I felt the lasagna holds up better that way (although this recipe is good even with more water). Use half parmesan and half romano cheese. It gives a slightly more robust flavor. Put a few tablespoons of the romano/parmesan cheese in with the ricotta mixture. Add a half teaspoon of grated nutmeg in with the ricotta mixture. Increase to one teaspoon of fennel seed. Use 23 ounces of ricotta instead of 16. Use bulk sausage meat if you can find it. Otherwise if you buy link sausage make sure to remove it from the casing and mix it with the ground beef. And finally (and this is very important), make the sauce the night before and leave it in the fridge overnight. The sauce tastes better and better as it sits and develops more richness of body and flavor. Trust me, all of these changes will improve the recipe! Mangia!",

Here is what I did (following others' suggestions in their reviews):\r\n\r\n- Soak noodles in very hot tap water for up to 30 mins while prepping sauce/ricotta mixture.\r\n- Use 1lb ground beef (they sell sweet Italian sausage at Trader Joe's, but I've used pork sausage with sweet chilis and that works, too).\r\n- Drain excess liquid after browning meat and before adding onions and garlic, then cook until onions are soft before adding the other ingredients to the sauce.\r\n- 6 cloves garlic instead of 2.\r\n- Only 6 oz tomato paste, instead of 12oz. \r\n- 1 Tablespoon of sugar instead of 2, and 1 teaspoon of salt (instead of 1 Tblsp).\r\n- 1/3 cup fresh basil instead of dried, if you have it (dried is fine otherwise).\r\n- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes.\r\n- Add 1 Tblsp parmesan and a dash of nutmeg to the ricotta mixture. \r\n- I've used both sliced mozz and fresh mozz - both work great. \r\n- Layer as follows (from bottom to top): 2 c meat sauce / 6 noodles (overlap them) / 1/2 ricotta mixture / 2 c meat sauce / 1/4 c parmesan / 1/2 of the mozzarella / 2 c meat sauce / 6 noodles / remaining ricotta mixture / 2 c meat sauce / remaining mozzarella / remaining parmesan. \r\n- Cover and refrigerate overnight. \r\n- Let sit at room temp for an hour before baking.\r\n\r\nEverything else in the recipe that I haven't mentioned, I followed as written. The lasagna got rave reviews and disappeared",

          "reviewBody": "I've convinced 3 (now-ex) boyfriends, my husband, and even a couple Italian friends at school that I make the most incredible lasagna they've ever tasted with this recipe. I make it pretty much as shown, except if I have the time, I let the sauce simmer on the stove as long as possible. I also add a bit of whatever red wine I have on hand to the sauce. And I try to make a double recipe, so I can use the sauce for other things - it works wonderfully for Chicken Parmesan, plain ol' spaghetti, and anywhere else you'd use a red sauce.\r\n\r\nEverything tastes better the second day, too. Oh, one more thing - I never boil my noodles. I simply buy regular dried noodles, and make sure I have plenty of sauce in the lasagna. It cooks long enough that the noodles boil in the oven, and you end up with a lasagna that isn't runny and holds its shape well.",

I read all the reviews before I started cooking and here's what I did to the recipe to make it extra yummy - 1. I used a lb. of Italian sausage and 1 1/2 lbs. of lean ground beef. 2. I chopped a medium onion instead of using minced onion. 3. I used six cloves of garlic instead of two. 4. I used a 1/2 c. of red wine instead of water. 5. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. 6. I used fresh chopped basil and fresh chopped parsley instead of dried. 7. I used 1 teaspoon of salt. 8. I doubled the ricotta. 9. I added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg to my ricotta mixture. 10. I grated a lb. of mozzarella cheese instead of using sliced mozzarella. Even though this recipe is a little time consuming, it's absolutely worth it!! This is the only lasagna recipe I will ever use from now on!!",

I read a lot of other people's comments. At the end of the day, I made the recipe as written except that I omitted the salt, use 1.25 pounds of ground beef, spicy italian sausage instead of sweet, and used only half the ricotta. How much ricotta you use is really up to personal taste. My view is a little goes a long ways. Several people mentioned doing it in three layers instead of two, but two took it up to the very top of the pan anyway. This recipe is great!",

          "reviewBody": "I must comment on the reactions to the sugar in the sauce...the purpose of the sugar is to counter the bitter back taste of the various tomato products &amp; not to sweeten it. Whenever I make a tomato sauce I taste and determine the amount of sugar needed usually it's about a tsp. I personally have never had to use that much sugar. Obviously the salt was a typo as many have stated, that much salt would give me a stroke. tip: In a small sautee pan put 2 or 3 Tb of olive oil and fresh minced garlic amount according to personal preference. (My family loves garlic so I use approx. 4 to 6 cloves and put it through a garlic press or simply smash) To this I add finely chopped onion, when the onion is tender I add all the seasonings minus the salt and seasonings are quite personal and differ as do people so use what you love, we like a little kick and use red pepper flakes. Turn down the temperature to low after it sizzles, put a lid on and allow to simmer. This is an important step as it infuses the flavors into the scant 'heart healthy' olive oil. Meanwhile cook and crumble desired meats. Lightly SALT your meat but not the sausage! Set aside. (drain the excess oil from the meat). NOTE a very small amount of salt brings out the flavor of your meats. The sauce however,should not be salted. I enjoy the Hunts flavored sauces and sometime will use their spaghetti sauce as a starter for my sauce only because it expedites time. Combine your sauce, meat and sauteed season., simmer/assemble.",

My husband told me that this sauce is better that the one I usually make and that one was from his motherâs recipe. This recipe makes a little more sauce that you need so I use the leftover for some pasta or ravioli few days later. I followed some suggestions from the previous reviews and from making this recipe few times here are some things I changed. \n*Used 1lb each of beef and Italian sausage\n*Used less salt (only about a teaspoon)\n*Used only 1 tablespoon of sugar in the sauce\n*Used wine instead of water\n*Used fresh chopped basil instead of dry (about Â½ cup)\n*Used âready to bakeâ lasagna noodles \n*Used fresh deli grade ricotta cheese not the processed stuff from the container\n*Used freshly grated Parmesan cheese\nThis is a 5 start lasagna recipe that it better than the one you order in the restaurant!! I often add spinach (fresh spinach wilted with some butter) to the ricotta cheese and it tastes great. Remember to always use as much fresh ingredients as you can â you will taste the difference (fresh ricotta and Parmesan, add fresh parsley and basil etc) Enjoy! Also, make the sauce a day earlier to save time.",

Some canned tomatoes and pastes have a sweeter taste than others, so I use taste as my only means for adding sugar.\n\nThis recipe was salt heavy for me - I've never added salt to ricotta and won't. Real ricotta has such a smooth, delicate flavor; I can't imagine what salt might do to it.\n\nThis is also very meaty. Though I prefer the blend of sausage/beef, I think it's a matter of personal preference. I also agree it needs more cheese, and we add different varities.\n\nThis is a good, basic recipe - add &amp; modify as you wish, it is a solid foundation.",

My guess is that they are too exposed to air.) Use a large iron skillet instead of roast pan.

      "description": "We set out to achieve a cookie that was crisp at the edges, chewy in the middle, and full of rich toffee flavor. The result? One of our most popular recipes of all time. Our perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe had to produce a cookie that would be moist and chewy on the inside and crisp at the edges, with deep notes of toffee and butterscotch to balance its sweetness. Melting the butter gave us the chewiness we were looking for. Cutting back on the flour and eliminating an egg white also improved texture and brought the brown sugar flavor to the fore. To give our chocolate chip cookie recipe the crisp edges and toffee flavor we wanted, we let the sugar dissolve in the batter for 10 minutes, then baked the cookies at a high temperature so the edges darkened while the centers stayed soft.",
